There are a ton of great resources all over the internet (including a
very awesome wiki) on the materials you should be studying before
attending Dev Bootcamp.  Inevitably, each studnent makes up their own
Frankenstein of a study guide by cobbling together content from a myriad of
different message boards, wikis and blogs.  I've done no differently,
curating my own set of ebooks and sites from which I have either learned a
ton or loathed (they are provided at the very end, scroll to bottom if 
feeling impatient).    

However...

Providing my list, while helpful, still leaves a lot unsaid.  While I
have read plenty of great write ups about the best tutorials for
learning control flow I have always felt there was a distinct lack of
practical advice that a new programmer can immediately apply.  Advice
that could be remixed and handed directly to other new programmers in an
endless loop of blogging tradition.

I wanted to fill that gap and it is my hope that most of this advice is 
immediately actionable or will be once you reach a certain point in your 
journey.  This is only a base, there is no way that one could ever compile 
a complete list as there is always so much that you do not know in development.

With that said:

### Be Ready to Fail, ALOT ###

You cannot be afraid of failure and must actively seek it out.  The
faster you fail the quicker you will get to a solution that is actually
workable.  Failure is only a minor bump in the road to your ultimate
destination, just ignore it completely.

### Get Comfortable with the Ruby Docs ###

Ruby documentation is always your first and best stop for figuring out
everything in the ruby world.  They are indespensible and you should
never be ashamed when you have to look up something in the core
documentation.  You will consistently refer to them throughout the rest
of your Ruby career, you can't hold all of that knowledge in your head.

### Hartl Should not be Your Intro to Ruby ###

Hartl is something that a beginner should shy away from initially (at
least until you have a somewhat firm grasp of Ruby).  As good as the
rails tutorial is Hartl only spends about 1 out of his 11 chapters on
basic Ruby and then breezes right back into Rails.  A lot of Rails will
appear as complete and utter magic without some Ruby in your repitore
(and even after you have a good understand of Ruby it still looks like
magic sometimes).  Take the time to go through a good intro Ruby
tutorial like this:


### Give Yourself time Before you Google ###

I always end up asking for help or Googling for my specific far too
quickly.  After I have received an easy answer to the problem, I
actually feel like I was robbed of something precious.  Struggling with
a problem and actually making a breakthrough will definitely cement your
knowledge.  Give yourself time to work through a problem but always set
a hardstop so you don't struggle past the point of fustration.
Depending on the issue I am tackling I usually give myself an hour.

### Spend as much time as you can reading other people's code ###

This is where you will gain the most insight into how many different
ways there are to do something in both Ruby and programming in general.
Reading as much code as you can will get you used to asking question,
stepping through a whole program and following a consistent syntax
styleguide.  Go look at any popular open source project and just absorb
its structure and try to get in contact with the maintainers.  You will
be surprised at how much this helps!

### Don't do just tutorials ###

Tutorials are great but I always felt like I was reading and typing more
than I was ever learning anything.  I always had the immediate urge to
just break off the beaten path and just start playing with the various
items I was supposed to be learning.  Inevitably you will get bored
going through any of the long tutorials.  Take a break!  Try to go build
something for yourself or just have some fun playing around with various
functions.  You can't always just study, need to hit the jungle gym from
time to time.

### Try to glance at another language ###

If you feel like you are burning through everything rather quickly and
you really want to expand your world view, go have a peek at another
language (try python).  Now, I am not telling you to go learn the ins
and outs of a whole different language but at least go appreciate and
understand the differences that other languages bring the the table.  As
my good friend would tell me, "Don't just be a Ruby fan boy".

### Don't look at an example out of a book without IRB ###

Alays make sure you are typing examples you see in books directly into
IRB.  While IRB can be cumbersome at times it is an invaluable tool for
testing all of the included ruby core methods.  Take every opportunity
you can to type examples out for yourself as it will lead to better
understanding in the long run.

### Get a whiteboard ###

Besides them just being great fun to draw on the provide a very
accessible way to quickly talk a variety of different programming
problems.  Programmers love whiteboards as you can discuss functions,
database schemas, site maps or even wireframe out designs.  Get a small
one for your office or room.  Best purchase you could make beyond
purchasing the Well Grounded Rubyist ebook :)

### Find a dev and become friends with them ###

You must have a developer BatPhone.  Behind every good developer is
another good developer who she/he can on for advice and/or problem
solving assistance.  I don't think I would be where I am today without
all of my dev friends being extremely generous with their time and
having extreme patience with my newness.

### Meetups, have you looked in your city ###

Look for your local Ruby group and get involved.  It's great to
socialize with other developers and you will be surprised by the fact
that many of them are ready to volunteer their time to help you
level-up.  I have always appreciated how inclusive meetups have been and
just how welcoming everyone I have meet at them has been.

Some or all of this advice may not work for you and that is just fine.
There isn't a single "Right" way to learn how to program or become a
developer.  Each path is unique and that is what makes the journey so
interesting.  Forget most, if not all of what I said and you will be
fine.
