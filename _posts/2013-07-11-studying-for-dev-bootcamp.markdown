There are a ton of great resources all over the internet (including a
very awesome wiki) on the materials you should be studying before
attending Dev Bootcamp.  Inevitably, each studnent makes up their own
Frankenstein of a study guide by cobbling together content from a myriad of
different message boards, wikis and blogs.  I've done no differently,
curating my own set of ebooks and sites from which I have either learned a
ton or loathed (they are provided at the very end, scroll to bottom if 
feeling impatient).    

However...

Providing my list, while helpful, still leaves a lot unsaid.  While I
have read plenty of great write ups about the best tutorials for
learning control flow I have always felt there was a distinct lack of
practical advice that a new programmer.  Advice that someone new could 
action and then put their own twist on before giving advice to another new
programmer. 

I wanted to fill that gap and it is my hope that most of this advice is 
immediately actionable or will be once you reach a certain point in your 
journey.  This is only a base, there is no way that one could ever compile 
a complete list as there is always so much that you do not know in development.

With that said:

### Be Ready to Fail, ALOT ###

### Get Comfortable with the Ruby Docs ###

### Hartl Should not be Your Intro to Ruby ###

### Give Yourself time Before you Google ###

### Spend as much time as you can reading other people's code ###

### Don't do just tutorials ###

### Try to glance at another language ###

### Don't an example out of a book without IRB ###

### Get a whiteboard ###

### Find a dev and become friends with them ###

### Meetups, have you looked in your city ###

Some or all of this advice may not work for you and that is just fine.
There isn't a single "Right" way to learn how to program or become a
developer.  Each path is unique and that is what makes the journey so
interesting.  Forget most, if not all of what I said and you will be
fine.
